I won’t get enough protein,"Yes, you will. There are plenty of plant-based foods that pack a protein punch from peanut butter and lentils to tofu and seitan"
Plants have feelings too,"Plants have no brain or central nervous system, which means they can’t feel anything. And if you’re really concerned about plants, you should be vegan anyway. Did you know it takes 16 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of beef? That’s a whole lotta plants for a few burgers."
Lions kill animals in the wild,"You’re not a predator or a committed carnivore who has no choice but hunt for food.

You’re a herbivore with a moral compass; eating meat is not necessary, and it’s down to you to make the ethical choice."
Cavemen ate meat,"Not so sure we should be making ethical choices based on what people may have done more than 100,000 years ago."
I’m just one person. If I decide not to eat meat it won’t make a difference,"It will to the approximately 30 farmed animals you spare each year. And with millions of vegans around the world, think of how many more we’ll save. Strength in numbers!"
"If we all stopped eating meat, farmed animals would take over the world","Sorry, but no. If meat consumption declined, fewer animals would be bred. It’s that simple."
"I focus my energy on helping people, not animals","By choosing to eat a humane vegan diet you are helping people too. Animals raised for food require massive amounts of grain that could be fed to the nearly 1 billion starving people around the globe instead. Additionally, factory farms pollute air and waterways and generate high volumes of dangerous methane gas."
I can't give up eating cheese,"Well, you don’t have to! Going vegan doesn’t mean limiting the foods you eat—it just means taking the cruelty out of them. Top your pizza with cashew-based mozzarella, sprinkle some vegan Parmesan on your pasta, and spread dairy-free cream cheese on your bagel."
Bacon tho,"It’s just pieces of flesh from the back of a tortured animal – not oxygen. As one of the most egocentric responses to veganism, ‘bacon tho’ makes me cringe. What kind of person are you if you value your taste buds more than the lives of other beings?"
but what about our Canines,"There are so many wrong things with this excuse, I don’t even know where to begin. First things first, humans’ canines are nothing like those of lions or other carnivores. Secondly, humans are naturally plant-based eaters, whose physiology evolved for processing starches, fruits, and vegetables, and not tearing and chewing flesh.Your canine teeth don’t make you a meat-eater; and even having a physical attribute that enables us to do harm, does not mean we are morally justified to do so."
Our ancestors ate meat,"Repeat after me: history does not equal justification. Even if we knew for sure what our early ancestors were eating, it wouldn’t make it logical to conclude that we should continue doing so."
we need to eat animal products for nutrition,"The American Dietetic Association and the British Dietetic Association, the largest bodies of nutrition and diet professionals in both countries, have both stated that a plant-based (vegan) diet is nutritionally adequate and safe for all stages of life, including pregnancy. Meaning that we can officially get all the nutrients we need without eating animals or their secretions. Protein, iron, calcium and every other nutrient that we associate with animal products can be obtained easily without the need for exploiting animals."
we need to eat animal products for nutrition,"The largest and strongest land animals in the world, the elephant, the rhino, the hippopotamus, what do they all have in common? They are all plant eaters. But does anyone think an elephant is protein deficient, or that a rhino has weak bones?"
Eating aniamls is traditional and culturual,"If humanity had gone through history too stubborn and ignorant to change because of so called tradition then we would never have evolved or adapted. Why is the unifying factor that binds all of humanity together the consumption of animals and not the universal acknowledgement that we are all brothers and sisters, creatures of this earth who are united by sharing one planet? Not the same but equal.
"
But we evolved eating meat,"In contemporary society we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions and in doing so we are shortening our lifespan, destroying our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary harm to innocent, living beings."
humans are more important than animals ,"We are currently growing enough food to feed around 12 billion people and yet in a world of only 7 and a half billion, around 800 million people are living in a state of starvation due to lack of food - food that we have but that we feed to non-human animals instead so that we can eat their flesh. In fact the United States alone could feed every single one of those 800 million people with the grain that they feed to livestock animals."
animals don't feel pain,"From a science perspective, non-human animals have the same or at least almost identical areas of the brain involved in processing pain and show similar pain behaviours to humans. It doesn’t matter what experience of pain you have only that you are capable of having a feeling that you don’t want to have. The same applies to animals, the fact that they can experience pain means that they have a preference to avoid it and by default, it is our moral obligation to ensure no unnecessary pain is caused to any living creature."

we're doing animals a favor by giving them life,"Do you think that a pig whose entire life is spent in confinement, with huge periods of time trapped inside a farrowing crate too small for her to even move or turn around in, should be grateful? Would you be grateful, watching your children being taken away from you and mutilated in front of you? What about being castrated and having your body parts chopped off, now do you feel indebted to the oppressors that created you?"
can't we just improve the lives of animals,"The reality is, it doesn’t matter what privilege or treatment the animals receive, if they are destined to be killed, exploited or abused in anyway then there is no ethical or humane way in which to treat these animals. The only humane method of slaughter is to not slaughter. The only happy chickens are the chickens that get to live a free life, truly free, not free-range.
Humane slaughter is an oxymoron, as is high welfare murder, or happy exploitation."
morality is subjective,"What morality really comes down to is the awareness of a victim. What is moral should be defined by whether or not what is being done has a victim that is suffering unnecessarily. I believe morality is as simple as “Would I want that done to me? And if not, what right do I have to do it to another?”."
eating meat in moderation,"it is not morally justifiable to only reduce the amount of animal products we consume, as even if it is ‘only’ once a week there is still a victim who is being negatively impacted for an unnecessary reason, this is precisely why moderation or reduction is not an ethical compromise, because it means nothing to the animal who is still being exploited and killed."
I love clams,"Clams are amazingly complex. They can change gender once during their lifetime, right after their juvenile stage, but only from male to female. Many other mollusks are either hermaphroditic or have the ability to change sex."
How Many Animals Are Killed for Food Every Year?,"More than 29 million cows suffer and die in the meat and dairy industries every year.
In the U.S., approximately 9 billion chickens are killed for their flesh each year and 305 million hens are used for their eggs.
Of the millions of pigs killed every year for food, more than 1 million die annually just during transport to the slaughterhouse, and at least 40,000 have sustained injuries by the time they arrive.
An estimated 245 million turkeys are raised and killed for their flesh every year in the U.S. More than 46 million of them are killed each year at Thanksgiving alone, and more than 22 million die at Christmas.
More than 31 million ducks are killed each year for their flesh and for cruelly obtained foie gras.
More fish are killed for food each year than all other animals combined, as tens of billions of fish and shellfish are slaughtered annually."
eat bacon,"Pigs are playful, friendly, sensitive, and intelligent animals. They've long been considered smarter than dogs, and the complexity of their social lives rivals those of primates. Much like people, pigs are soothed by music, love playing ball, and even enjoy getting massages."
eat chicken,"Leading animal behavior scientists from around the globe know that chickens are inquisitive and interesting animals whose cognitive abilities are on par with those of cats, dogs, and even some primates. Like all animals, chickens love their families and value their own lives. Their social nature means that they’re always looking out for their families and for other chickens in their group. People who have spent time with them know that they have complex social structures and adept communication skills, just as we do."
eat fish,"Fascinating Facts About Fish. Fish talk to each other using squeaks, squeals, and other low-frequency sounds that humans can hear only with special instruments.
They also communicate through “sign language” or “Morse code.” Lionfish wave the row of fins on their backs in a specific way to signal other fish to join them in a hunt. Large coral groupers alert smaller, more slender fish, like moray eels, to prey fish concealed in a crevice by pointing their noses toward the concealed fish and shaking their bodies from side to side—the obliging eel then flushes out the prey.
They like physical contact with other fish and often gently rub against one another—in the same way that a cat weaves in and out of your legs."
eat beef,"According to research, cows are generally quite intelligent animals who can remember things for a long time. Animal behaviorists have found that they interact in socially complex ways, developing friendships over time and sometimes holding grudges against other cows who treat them badly."
wearing wool,"Sheep are gentle individuals who, like all animals, feel pain, fear, and loneliness. But because there’s a market for their fleece and skins, they’re treated as nothing more than wool-producing machines. Within weeks of birth, lambs’ ears are hole-punched, their tails are chopped off, and the males are castrated without any painkillers. Male lambs are castrated when they are between 2 and 8 weeks old, either by making an incision and cutting their testicles out or with a rubber ring used to cut off blood supply—one of the most painful methods of castration possible. When the lambs’ testicles don’t fall off as expected, shearers often just cut off them with clippers. Every year, hundreds of lambs die before the age of 8 weeks from exposure or starvation, and mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect."

egg prices,"Once an animal on a farm is determined to have the bird flu, the entire population is killed. In the largest mass slaughter on any factory farm in the country, workers at one of the world’s largest egg factories were directed to kill more than 5 million chickens after a single case of avian influenza was detected."
